# PracticingPython

I am making the switch from Java to Python because it is faster and more widely used.
I decided to use the same warmup problems that I used to teach myself Java, to teach myself Python.

It is much easier doing them after understanding the algorithms in Java. I am just getting used to the
syntax of python, so this is a useful exercise as I begin to explore Django and other Python based technologies.
